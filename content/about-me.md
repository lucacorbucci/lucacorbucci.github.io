Hi 👋, I am Luca, a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pisa 🇮🇹 under the supervision of Prof. [Anna Monreale](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bA-rXeUAAAAJ). My main research interests are Federated Learning and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning. However, I am attracted to new technologies. Therefore, I am also open to working on different and innovative topics.

🧑‍🎓 I received a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2018 and a M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2021 with a thesis about “Semantic enrichment of XAI explanations for healthcare”. In 2019, I spent one semester at the Computer Science Department of the Technische Universität München 🇩🇪 as an exchange student thanks to the Erasmus program.

📱 I worked as a Flutter Developer at Tocket from March 2020 to January 2021. During that period, I developed the Tocket application, published on the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store.

🔍 I am currently spending a period as a visiting PhD student in the Telefonica R&D department in Barcelona 🇪🇸 under the supervision of [Nicolas Kourtellis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q5oWwiQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

🎙 I have always been attracted to communities. Between 2013 and 2015, I worked as an editor for Biteyourapple.net, writing more than 1,000 posts, recording videos and participating in the Bitecast podcast. I am the [PointerPodcast](https://pointerpodcast.it/) co-founder. PointerPodcast is a podcast about technology and innovation. We have published more than 170 episodes since its creation in 2019. In most of them, we interview software engineers and researchers from academia and industry. Lately, I have founded two communities. The first is Superhero Valley, a community that tries to fill the gap between university and industry. It does this by providing awareness of the opportunities offered by big tech companies to students. The second is Pisa.dev a local community that organizes meetups for developers and computer scientists in Pisa 🇮🇹.

🍦 In my free time I enjoy acting as a critique about books and TV shows. I also try to prepare myself for marathons sooner or later. If you are interested in all these things, [I created a page to share all these details](/picks/).
