Hi 👋, I am Luca, a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pisa 🇮🇹 under the supervision of Prof. [Anna Monreale](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bA-rXeUAAAAJ) and Dr. [Nicolas Kourtellis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q5oWwiQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My main research interest is Responsible AI. In particular, I am currently working on Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning, Model (Un)Fairness and Explainability. 
However, I am attracted to new technologies. Therefore, I am also open to working on different and innovative topics.

### Education

🧑‍🎓 I received a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2018 and a M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2021 with the thesis “[Semantic enrichment of XAI explanations for healthcare](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-45275-8_15)”. 
In 2019, I spent one semester at the Computer Science Department of the Technische Universität München 🇩🇪 as an exchange student thanks to the Erasmus program.

In 2021 I started my PhD at the University of Pisa. During the PhD I spent 12 months as a Research Intern at the Telefonica Research Center in Barcelona 🇪🇸. I am grateful to have been supervised by [Nicolas Kourtellis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q5oWwiQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Mikko Heikkila](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8qSL6B0AAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao) and [David Solans](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hcZ0tb8AAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao). During this period I worked on Private and Fair Federated Learning under the Spatial EU Project.

### Podcast and Communities

<!-- I enjoy organising meetups and communities. I am currently involved in the following projects:

- PointerPodcast

  - I’m the co-founder of “[PointerPodcast](https://pointerpodcast.it/)” a podcast about technology and innovation. We have published more than 150 episodes since its creation in 2019. In most of them, we interview software engineers and researchers from both academia and industry.

- SuperHeroesValley

  - I'm the co-founder of “[SuperHeroesValley](https://www.superheroesvalley.fun/)”, a community that organizes online meetups for ambitious CS students to build a bridge between universities and big tech companies. We founded the community in October 2020 and organized more than 50 meetups since then.

- Pisa.dev

  - I'm the co-founder and organizer of [Pisa.dev](https://www.pisa.dev) a community based in Pisa that organizes meetups for developers and computer scientists. -->

🎙 I have always been attracted to communities. Between 2013 and 2015, I worked as an editor for Biteyourapple.net, writing more than 1,000 posts, recording videos and participating in the Bitecast podcast. I am the [PointerPodcast](https://pointerpodcast.it/) co-founder. PointerPodcast is a podcast about technology and innovation. We have published more than 170 episodes since its creation in 2019. In most of them, we interview software engineers and researchers from academia and industry. Lately, I have founded two communities. The first is Superhero Valley, a community that tries to fill the gap between university and industry. It does this by providing awareness of the opportunities offered by big tech companies to students. The second is Pisa.dev a local community that organizes meetups for developers and computer scientists in Pisa 🇮🇹.

🍦 In my free time I enjoy acting as a critique about books and TV shows. I also try to prepare myself for marathons sooner or later. If you are interested in all these things, [I created a page to share all these details](/picks/).


### Volunteering

- GDG Pisa Devfest 2024: I was one of the helpers of GDG Pisa Devfest 2024.

- GDG Pisa Devfest 2023: I was one of the helpers of GDG Pisa Devfest 2023. I was one of the stage managers and helped record interviews with attendees and speakers. The video of the interviews is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0abyLm5x7yg).
