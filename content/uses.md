# Desk Setup


My setup changed a bit since the last time I updated this page. I think that the current one allows me to be productive and to work comfortably. This last point is really important for me since I spend a lot of time in front of the computer. Here's a list of the things I have on my desk:

- The desk is a [Rodulf Standing Desk by Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/it/it/p/rodulf-scrivania-regolabile-in-altezza-grigio-bianco-s99326170/), a cheap standing desk that I bought in 2021. It's big enough and I can't live without it now.
- I've tried many desk lamps over the past few years. All of them have something that I did not like. In the end, I tried the [Xiaomi Mi Computer Monitor Light Bar](https://www.mi.com/it/product/mi-computer-monitor-light-bar/) and I think that it's the best compromise between space occupied on the desk and light produced.
- I have a [Ikea Eifred](https://www.ikea.com/it/it/p/eifred-sedia-con-appoggio-per-ginocchia-gunnared-nero-grigio-90527069/) but I'm not using it too much lately since I prefer to work standing up or sitting on a chair.

## Hardware

- **Mac Mini 2024** - Apple M4 Processor - 24GB RAM - I can't be happier with this machine. It is powerful enough for everything, it is silent and it consumes very little power. I should start using it also as a "home server" for hosting some services like I was used to do with my old MacBook Pro.
- [Samsung Odyssey G9](https://www.samsung.com/it/monitors/gaming/odyssey-oled-g9-g95sc-49-inch-240hz-curved-dual-qhd-ls49cg950suxen/) - It is a 49-inch OLED monitor. It is a pleasure for the eyes to work in front of it.
- **Logitech Mx Master 3S For Mac** - It took me a while to get used to it but now I don't know how I could work without it.
- **Apple Magic Trackpad** - I use it sometimes, especially when I record podcasts.
- **[Keychron K8](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k8-tenkeyless-wireless-mechanical-keyboard)** - This is my main keyboard. 
- **Apple Magic Keyboard** - This is the keyboard I use when I record podcast or when I want to take a break from the Keychron.
- **Rode NT-USB** - This is the microphone I use for recording podcasts. 

## Software

- [Hidden Bar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066?mt=12)
- [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) is a porting of i3 to macOS. I've never used something like this in the past but after I started using the Samsung Odyssey G9 I decided to try it to exploit as much as possible the space offered by this monitor.
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
- [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) is an open-source text expander developed by Federico Terzi. Federico [was a guest in a PointerPodcast episode](https://pointerpodcast.it/p/pointer46-espanso-rust-e-open-source-con-federico-terzi/).
- [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12)
- I've been using [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) as my iOS podcast player for years. It has a lot of interesting features that improve the podcast listening experience.
- I use [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) as my password manager. Even if the user experience could be improved, I like their culture a lot. It is Open source and with the free version, you would be able to use it without too many limitations. However, I decided to support their work by buying a premium subscription.

## Gaming

I recently bought a Nintendo Switch 2 after years of waiting. Since I'm not a gamer, I feel that this console is perfect for me. I'm usually playing games like Mario Kart World or Mario Odyssey or indie games like Celeste. I like to play to relax while resting on the bed or the sofa so the portability of the console is really important for me.
I don't consider myself a gamer but I really enjoy playing these games on the Switch.

## Other stuffs I use

- **iPad 11th generation with A16 chip** -  I use it mainly for reading, taking notes and watching videos. It is a great device for consuming content and it is not too expensive.
- **Nothing Phone 3a Pro** - I finally switched to Android after many years using iPhones. The Nothing Phone was a great compromise between price and performance. Moreover, it doesn't have any bloatware and the design is really unique.
- **Amazon Kindle Paperwhite** - This is my ebook reader, it is compact enough to fit in my bag.
- **Apple Airpods Pro** - The best earphones I've ever had. I use them for everything. They're simply the best product Apple has produced in years.
- **Nothing Ear** - These come bundled with the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. I use them when I'm not at home connected with the Nothing Phone.
