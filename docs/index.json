It was my first ever in-presence talk after two years of online events and presentations made in front of a screen. I can\u0026rsquo;t find the words to express all my joy and the emotions I felt before, during and after the talk, it was just amazing. I\u0026rsquo;m so grateful to the organizers that allowed me to be there.\nI gave a talk about Streamlit, in particular, I introduced Streamlit and I explained how can it be used to develop simple user interfaces to report, for example, the results of a project.\nThe slides of my talk are available here (the English version is available here). I published the code of the demo I prepared for the talk on my Github account. Unfortunately, we had some problems before the talk and I had to change the computer so I was not able to do the demo.\nSee you next year!\n","date":"11 June 2022","permalink":"/posts/stories/3/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"My talk at Pycon IT üáÆüáπ 2022 "},{"content":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:\nFlutter After a Year of Inactivity Bugs in Hello World Why you shouldn‚Äôt use pie charts Embracing Impostor Syndrome Apple: M1 Ultra Meanings and Consequences Light Mode, Dark Mode, and Gen-Z Mode A Proposal For Type Syntax in JavaScript Inspecting Web Views in macOS Teaching is a slow process of becoming everything you hate ","date":"15 March 2022","permalink":"/posts/news/07/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"A list of blog post I've read this week - Issue #7"},{"content":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:\nAlphaCode as a dog speaking mediocre English DeepETA: How Uber Predicts Arrival Times Using Deep Learning \u0026ldquo;Math neurons\u0026rdquo; identified in the brain My journey from macOS to FreeBSD The cats sitting on a fence in early builds of Windows 8 ","date":"13 February 2022","permalink":"/posts/news/06/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"A list of blog post I've read this week - Issue #6"},{"content":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:\nHow we‚Äôre helping developers with differential privacy Practical Differentially Private Clustering When the Algorithm Is Your Boss Maze generation with Variational Autoencoders Introducing StylEx: A New Approach for Visual Explanation of Classifiers ","date":"6 February 2022","permalink":"/posts/news/05/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"A list of blog post I've read this week - Issue #5"},{"content":"This is the list of blog post I\u0026rsquo;ve read this week:\nAI could end foreign-language subtitles 29-year-old Conway conjecture settled webassembly: the new kubernetes?

I think that it allows me to be productive and to work comfortably. This last point is really important for me since I spend a lot of time in front of the computer. Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of the things I have on my desk:\nThe desk is a Rodulf Standing Desk by Ikea, a cheap standing desk that I bought in 2021. It\u0026rsquo;s big enough and I can\u0026rsquo;t live without it now. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried many desk lamps over the past few years. All of them have something that I did not like. In the end, I tried the Xiaomi Mi Computer Monitor Light Bar and I think that it\u0026rsquo;s the best compromise between space occupied on the desk and light produced. I have a Ikea Eifred Hardware # MacBook Pro 13\u0026quot; (2020) - M1 Processor - 16GB RAM - Probably the best computer I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had. It\u0026rsquo;s fast, silent and the battery lasts forever. I\u0026rsquo;m really happy with it. Samsung Odyssey G9 - It is a 49-inch OLED monitor. It is a pleasure for the eyes to work in front of it. Apple Magic Trackpad Logitech Mx Master 3S For Mac Keychron K8 Apple Magic Keyboard MacBook Pro 2016 15 with Touchbar\u0026quot; - Used as a server for hosting some services like Plex. The screen is broken but it\u0026rsquo;s still working fine if used as a server. Software # Hidden Bar Aerospace is a porting of i3 to macOS. I\u0026rsquo;ve never used something like this in the past but after I started using the Samsung Odyssey G9 I decided to try it to exploit as much as possible the space offered by this monitor. Alfred Espanso is an open-source text expander developed by Federico Terzi. Federico was a guest in a PointerPodcast episode. Amphetamine I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Overcast as my iOS podcast player for years. It has a lot of interesting features that improve the podcast listening experience. I use Bitwarden as my password manager. Even if the user experience could be improved, I like their culture a lot. It is Open source and with the free version, you would be able to use it without too many limitations. However, I decided to support their work by buying a premium subscription. Notion Fantastical Other stuffs I use # iPad 6th generation - 32GB - I use it mainly for reading and taking notes. iPhone 7 Plus - I\u0026rsquo;ve had it for a while and it\u0026rsquo;s still working fine. However, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll replace it when the new iPhone will come out in September. Amazon Kindle Paperwhite - This is my ebook reader, it is compact enough to Apple Airpods Pro - The best earphones I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had. I use them for everything. They\u0026rsquo;re simply the best product Apple has produced in years. Apple Watch Series 4 - I use it mainly for logging my runs and for notifications. I think I would live without it.

If you want a more detailed description you can read my CV or visit my LinkedIn account Hi üëã, I am Luca, a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pisa üáÆüáπ under the supervision of Prof. Anna Monreale and Dr. Nicolas Kourtellis. My main research interest is Responsible AI. In particular, I am currently working on Privacy-Presering Machine Learning, Model (Un)Fairness and Explainability. However, I am attracted to new technologies. Therefore, I am also open to working on different and innovative topics.\nEducation #üßë‚Äçüéì I received a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2018 and a M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2021 with the thesis ‚ÄúSemantic enrichment of XAI explanations for healthcare‚Äù. In 2019, I spent one semester at the Computer Science Department of the Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen üá©üá™ as an exchange student thanks to the Erasmus program.\nIn 2021 I started my PhD at the University of Pisa. During the PhD I spent 12 months as a Research Intern at the Telefonica Research Center in Barcelona üá™üá∏. I am grateful to have been supervised by Nicolas Kourtellis, Mikko Heikkila and David Solans. During this period I worked on Private and Fair Federated Learning under the Spatial EU Project.\nEducation # (2021 \u0026ndash; Present) Ph.D. in Computer Science \u0026ndash; University of Pisa, Italy üáÆüáπ\nMain research interests: Private and Fair Federated Learning (Oct 2019 \u0026ndash; Mar 2020) International Exchange \u0026ndash; Technical University of Munich, Germany üá©üá™\n(2018 \u0026ndash; 2021) Master Degree in Computer Science \u0026ndash; University of Pisa, Italy üáÆüáπ\nThesis: Semantic Enrichment of XAI Explanation for Healthcare (supervisor: Prof. Anna Monreale, Dott.

Between 2013 and 2015, I worked as an editor for Biteyourapple.net, writing more than 1,000 posts, recording videos and participating in the Bitecast podcast. I am the PointerPodcast co-founder. PointerPodcast is a podcast about technology and innovation. We have published more than 170 episodes since its creation in 2019. In most of them, we interview software engineers and researchers from academia and industry. Lately, I have founded two communities. The first is Superhero Valley, a community that tries to fill the gap between university and industry. It does this by providing awareness of the opportunities offered by big tech companies to students. The second is Pisa.dev a local community that organizes meetups for developers and computer scientists in Pisa üáÆüáπ.\nüç¶ In my free time I enjoy acting as a critique about books and TV shows. I also try to prepare myself for marathons sooner or later.
